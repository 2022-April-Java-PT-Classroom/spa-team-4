            <p>Hi! My name is Aisha (phonetic spelling: ay-zhuh).
               I am a junior full-stack software developer pursuing my passion in coding, reigniting the days of my youth
                where I'd make front-end websites of my favorite cartoon/video game characters in the early and late 2000s.
                 I am a highly focused problem solver with excellent research and troubleshooting skills, committed to
                 breaking into the tech industry.</p>
